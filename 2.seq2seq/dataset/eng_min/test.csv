The resto's food has a lot of variety, tastes great, the strawberry sambal is especially unique and tasty. Nasi liwet with strawberry is a must-try. So far, none of the meals have been disappointing. Highly recommended for family travels.","pelayanan elok, tampek parkir lumayan luweh, kabun stroberi luweh dan banyak stroberi nan alah cukuik merah untuak dipatiak. Makanan direstoran baragam bana, rasonyo lamak, lado stroberinyo unik dan lamak. Nasi liwet stroberi harus dicubo. Sajauah ko sado menunan awak makan ndak ado nan mambuek kecewa direkomendasian bana untuak jalan-jalan samo keluarga."

Horrible service.","Manunggu makanannyo lamo bana, waitressnyo pamberang, pas makanannyo waktu tu wak pasan pizza tibo eh anguih sampai kasirnyo pun pas wak baia ndak senyum, palayanannyo payah."
