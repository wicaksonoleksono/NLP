If the place was that crowded, the resto staff should've told the customers before they park their cars while it's raining heavily outside, as the distance between the parking lot and the resto was quite far. Better yet, they should've closed the resto temporarily while the party was going on.","Wak tibo ka maxi s resto samo keluarga, ruponyo di sinan ado pesta pernikahan pesta ulang tahun sahinggo tampek jadi panuah bana.
